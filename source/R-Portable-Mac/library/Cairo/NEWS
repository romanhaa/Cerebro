NEWS/Changelog

1.5-9	(2015-09-25)
    o	work around bug #45376 in freetype 2.6.0 causing compilation
	failure


1.5-8	(2015-07-29)
    o	fix a premature memory release in locator handling for
	raster back-ends.


1.5-7	(2015-07-27)
    o	fix a segfault in CairoFontMatch() in case FcNameParse()
	fails (closes #10)

    o	image back-end can now provide custom locator if
	a `locator` argument is passed to `Cairo()` with the desired
	callback function. The callback function accepts `dev` argument
	and should return either a numeric vector of length 2 (x, y)
	or `NULL`. This is mainly useful for `type='raster'` passed to
	external UI where that UI can provide locator capability.

    o   add Cairo.snapshot() which is similar to recordPlot() but
	also allows the retrieval of the last snapshot.


1.5-6	(2014-06-26)
    o	scale line width by the same amount as fonts such that
	resolution changes are consistent even in that respect


1.5-5	(2013-12-23)
    o	fix onSave reporting incorrect page number for the last page
	(introduced in 1.5-4, closes #6)

    o	scale fonts unconditionally according to the dpi adjustment
	(fixes issues with grid graphics and dpi changes)


1.5-4	(2013-12-12)
    o	fix invalid pointsize scaling if dpi auto-detection is used
	(closes #1)

    o	fix failure to emit final page in some multi-page settings
	(closes #4)

    o	the `res' parameter in CairoPNG(), CairoTIFF() and CairoJPEG()
	it now passed down to Cairo() which now accepts `res' to
	override the value of `dpi' if `res' is set to anyhting other
	than NA or NULL. (closes #3)

    o	release onSave callback function on close (closes #2)


1.5-3	(2013-12-03)
    o	remove compatibility layers to make R 3.x happy

    o	adjust pointsize according to the dpi setting


1.5-2	(2012-11-05)
    o	added Cairo.onSave() callback which allows R code to be run
	when Cairo finishes a page

    o	added Cairo.serial() function which allows user code to check
	whether the graphics have been updated

    o	bugfix/update in Cairo connection patch (by Karl Millar)


1.5-1	(2011-12-10)
    o	add support for dev.hold()/dev.flush()

    o	use new R 2.14.0 device capabilities advertizing feature

    o	fix memory leak when setting fonts via CairoFonts()

    o	explicitly request font anti-aliasing even if it is not the
	surface default - in particular Windows has disabled font
	anti-aliasing by default


1.5-0	(2011-09-30)
    o	fix swapped bold vs italic traits if freetype is not available

    o	use Times font for symbols on Windows because Symbol font
	doesn't seem to support Unicode

    o	add support for poly-paths

    o	add support for dev.capture()/grid.cap()

    o	added new type "raster" that creates an image back-end without
	any output file. It can be used in conjunction with
	dev.capture() to create in-memory image representations, e.g.:
	Cairo(type='raster')
	plot(1:10, col=2)
	p = writePNG(dev.capture(native=TRUE), raw())
	will create a raw vector containg a PNG image.


1.4-9	(2011-04-06)
    o	force static built-in libraries on Windows to prevent Cairo
	from picking up broken system libraries

1.4-8	(2011-03-07)
    o	spurious character in the 1.4-7 w32-backed source has made it
	unusable on Windows. This is a re-packaging of 1.4-7 without
	that spurious character.

1.4-7	(2011-03-07)
    o	fix a bug in raster support causing raster to be usable only
	once

    o	win backend: release and re-get DC on resize -- fixes resizing
	issues in CairoWin() for some Windows versions

1.4-6	(2011-02-10)
    o	adds raster image support (courtesy of R core)

    o	update Windows libcairo binary to cairo 1.10.2, use static
	build to avoid DLL issues and add 64-bit binary

1.4-5	(2009-07-16)
    o	minor Windows configuration change

    o	fix SET_VECTOR_ELT issue for R 2.9.0+

1.4-4	(2008-10-17)
    o	adapt to changes in R-devel (2.9.0-to-be), clean up warnings

1.4-3	(2008-07-21)
    o	make the use of an invalid font non-fatal

    o	allow Cairo to compile on some older systems that don't have
	trunc()

    o	updated libcairo binary for Windows to 1.6.4 (from GTK+)

1.4-2	(2008-04-03)
    o	adapt to even more changes in R 2.7

1.4-1	(2008-03-14)
    o	adapt to R 2.7 changes

1.4-0
    o	fix DPI detection in X11 back-end and use 90dpi as a fallback

    o	fix cra settings to be closer to what other devices use

    o	CairoX11 no longer fixes DPI to 72, "auto" is now the default.
	In addition, CairoWin and CairoX11 allow additional arguments
	to ba passed to Cairo.

1.3-5	(2007-08-27)
    o	adapt to const char* CHARs in R-devel

    o	fix a bug in CairoSVG (wrong argument name)

    o	fix a bug in CairoPS (units were not set to "in" and
	width/height had no defaults)

    o	fix unintentional doubling of the .ps suffix

1.3-4	(2007-05-10)
    o	more fixes in flag-guessing

    o	some vector backends (e.g. PDF, SVG) were falling back to
	bitamp rasterization, we try to prevent this 

    o	address expose issues with some X11 servers

    o	add CairoSVG wrapper

    o	add an unified way to register back-ends and get a list of all
	supported types.

    o	add Cairo.capabilities() function

1.3-3	2007-04-25
    o	improve detection of cairo and its dependencies

    o	work around missing API such that cairo 1.0 can be used.
	However, it is strongly encouraged to use cairo 1.2 or
	possibly 1.4 as they contain important bugfixes.

    o	fix page numbering to start at 1 (was 0) and update
	documentation correspondingly

1.3-2	2007-04-18
    o	added format autodetection for tiff and png. The 32-bit
	version of either format is used if the background
	is not opaque.

    o	fixed bug in the value returned by Cairo

    o	added type and file attributes to the Cairo object

    o	added (hidden, experimental) functions that allow direct
	modification of image content in Cairo (.image, .ptr.to.raw
	and .raw.to.ptr)

1.3-1
    o	change semantics of canvas and bg to match other devices:
	canvas is used by devices that don't support any kind
	of transparency in case bg is translucent

    o	fixed data ordering issues in TIFF and JPEG output

    o	added "compression" parameter to TIFF back-end which
	now defaults to LZW compression

1.3-0
    o	add support for canvas and dpi specification

    o	allow backends to detect native resolution

    o	add support for custom parameters (e.g. quality for jpeg)

1.2-1
    o	improve rendering on bitmap devices by aligning straight lines
	to the pixel grid and adding bleed to such fills.

    o	added wrappers that take exactly the same parameters as
	existing devices such as png, jpeg, pdf, postscript, X11 or
	windows and map them to calls to Cairo. They can be used to
	replace native devices by Cairo without the need to change
	existing code.

    o	added namespace

1.2-0
    o	additional interactive back ends: X11 (XLib) and win (Win32)

    o	enhanced back-end API to support interactive back-ends

    o	change default backgroud color to "white", because
	alpha-blending doesn't work properly in cairo when painting on
	purely transparent background.

    o	change the way filenames are interpreted, use multi-file
	printf convention as other devices do.

    o	added support for jpeg and tiff image formats

1.1-0
    o	additional file/stream back-ends: svg, ps

    o	enhanced back-end API

1.0-0
    o	fixed function names to not conflict with GDD

0.1-5
    o   added R connections patch support at config time.
