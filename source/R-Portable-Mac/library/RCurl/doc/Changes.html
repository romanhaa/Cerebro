</head>
<body>

<h2>1.95-4</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Important fix in a low-level bug in R_curl_easy_setopt
        where we were assuming the logical vector isProtected
       had the same length as values.  Thanks to Bruce Hoff for
       identifying this and providing a patch.
  <dd>
  <dt>
  <li>  Correction for mapping new lines in curlPercentEncode().
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>1.95-1 &amp;2 &amp; 3</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Changes for simpler compilation by others on Windows.
  <dd> The changes are appreciated.
      
  <dt>
  <li> postForm() coerces only atomic arguments for the form, leaving,
      for example, FileUploadInfo objects as they are.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>1.95-0</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>
  <li> Expose interface to C routine for  posting a form, .postForm().
  <dd> Request and patch from Hadley Wickham.
  
  <dt>
  <li>  Field httpHeader added to the error/condition object when an
        HTTP error is raised.
  <dd>
  
  <dt>
  <dd> Added close() method for CFILE.
  <dt>
      
  <li> stop.if.HTTP.error() now raises an error for 4xx and 5xx status codes.
  <dd> Thanks to Thomas Themel.
</dl>

<h2>1.94-0</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Fix to getForm() to allow the URL to contain a ?, e.g. with
       some parameters specified in the URL
  <dd>

      
</dl>

<h2>1.93-0</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> getURLContent()'s header parameter can be TRUE or FALSE. TRUE
      returns the header along with the body as a list containing just
      these two elements.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li>  postForm() coerces its arguments to characters so we can pass
        values of arbitrary types.
  <dd>
  <dt>
  <li>  postForm() checks the header in the response and throws an
        error if the request was not successful.

  <dt>
  <li>  Added finalizer for CFILE()
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li>  Allow writefunction and headerfunction to return TRUE to
        indicate success.
  <dd>
  <dt>
  <li>  Exported AUTH_* variables, e.g. AUTH_BASIC, AUTH_DIGEST, etc.
  <dd>
  <dd>
</dl>
<h2>1.92-1</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Set the error buffer when we call reset for a curl object.
  <dd> Thanks to Hadley Wickham for bringing this to my attention.
</dl>

<h2>1.92-0</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Added conversion for downloaded content to map
       Unicode characters of the form \unnnn to proper UTF encoding in R.
  <dd> Code is adapted from Alex Couture-Beil's rjson package. Thanks.
  <dt>
  <li> Added CURLAUTH_* constants, e.g. CURLAUTH_BASIC, CURLAUTH_NONE,
         CURLAUTH_ANY, ...
  <dd>      
</dl>

<h2>1.91-1</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Move logo.jpg and a reference to it in an example.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>1.91-0</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Enhanced httpPUT to make it simpler and take care of
      serializing the content and setting the necessary options.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>1.9-5</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li>  Enable the examples in getURL() help page if the session is
      interactive so that they won't be run in test/check mode.
  <dd>
</dl>


<h2>1.9-4</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> RCurl doesn't have to be in the search path to find the
      curlError() function which is called when an error occurs in curlPerform().
  <dd>

</dl>

<h2>1.9-3</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
      Import methods.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>1.9-2</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>  Documentation updates.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>1.9-1</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Avoid warnings about names slot in an EnumValue by adding an
       explicit names slot.  This was a result of a change in R-2.14.0.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>1.9-0</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Introduced url.exists() function.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Introduced curlError() and a collection of error "condition"
       objects corresponding to CURLCode status errors.  Errors can
       now be caught with tryCatch according to their class.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li>  Examples check the URLs are accessible before making the requests.
  <dd> The tests do not.
</dl>

<h2>1.8-0</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> getURLContent() attempts to handle encoding more comprehensively.
  <dd>
      
  <dt>
  <li> Added encoding argument for dynCurlReader() function.
  <dd> This attempts to use this encoding for the content it receives
       when it is not binary, but text.

  <dt>
  <li> dynCurlReader() has a more complete reset function and
       some additional state variables (e.g. requestCount).
       Contributed by Jeroen Ooms.
  <dd>
</dl>


<h2>1.7-0</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>
  <li> Added simple wrapper functions
        httpGET, httpPOST, httpPUT, httpHEAD, httpOPTIONS and
        httpDELETE corresponding to the HTTP methods.
      
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> postForm() now correctly handles multiple form parameters with
       the same name (rather than reusing the first value multiple times).
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>1.6-10</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>
  <li> Fix garbage collection for common case of calling
       getURLContent() that uses the default value of the header parameter.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>1.6-9</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>
  <li> Removed inclusion of curl/types.h which is now not part of
       libcurl in many installations.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>1.6-8</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Added isHTTP to dynCurlReader so that we can better handle FTP requests.
  <dd>
</dl>


<h2>1.6-7</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Fixed the case when we omitted the name of the field in httpheaders when there was just one entry
       which contains a ':', e.g. <code class="r">c(SOAPAction = "http://www.omegahat.net")</code>.

  <dd>
</dl>



<h2>1.6-6</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Fixed a problem when no Content-Encoding is returned.
  <dd> Discovered by Philip Laflamme.    
</dl>

<h2>1.6-5</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Modified the FTP example in getURL() to account for the rare
       case that after we get the list of files in a directory on the
      server,   one or more of them is deleted when we return to
      retrieve it.
  <dd> This appears to be occurring i386-apple-darwin9.8.0 (32-bit)
       but not on other platforms.
</dl>

<h2>1.6-4</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Fix for uploading data from memory in PUT or POST with the
      readfunction option. There was an off by one error that caused
      an extra byte to be upload in some/most circumstances.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Workaround in C code underlying getURIAsynchronous()  that fails on
       Fedora 14 with libcurl 7.21.*
  <dd> See http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnash-dev/2010-08/msg00156.html
</dl>

<h2>1.6-3</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> getForm() now correctly processes multiple instances of a
      form parameter with the same name rather than using the value of
      the first  version, e.g. arg1 = 'bob', arg1 = 'jane'.
      Found by  Richard Cotton.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>1.6-2</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Correction of bug fix in 1.6-1 to ensure results are
      returned. 
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>1.6-1</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Changed postForm() to not register a headerfunction if either
      writefunction or headerfunction is specified by the caller in
      the options.
  <dd> Discovered by Jereon Ooms
</dl>

<h2>1.6-0</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>
  <li> Respect Content-Encoding for determining if returned content is binary.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Pass the encoding to the dynamic content reader.
  <dd>  
  <dt>
  <li> curlPercentEncode has a new post.amp parameter controlling
      whether the % characters introduce by inserting escape codes
      are also escaped, i.e. # becomes %23 and then %2523 since %25 is
      the code for %
  <dd>
  
  <dt>
  <li> When posting a form via postForm(), individual parameters can
       have the class "AsIs" to avoid escaping their contents,
      e.g. converting &amp;, spaces, etc. to percent-encodings.
  <dd>  
  <dt>
  <li> Added json to the list of text content types.
  <dd>
</dl>



<h2>1.5-0</h2>

<dl>
 <dt>
 <li>  Added .isProtected  parameter to curlSetOpt() to allow caller control
       the preservation of the values from garbage collection to ensure they
       are not garbage collected while the curl handle is still alive.
 <dd> This solves the problem
</dl>




<h2>1.4-3</h2>
<dl>
  <dt> Fix for ftpUpload() to close the connection to a local file if
      that is what is being uploaded (rather than content in memory).
      Identified by Spencer Graves.
  <dd>
</dl>


<h2>1.4-3</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Added fields for debugGatherer() for the SSL  data-in and
       data-out fields which was causing an error if SSL was being
       used with debugging information.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>1.4-2</h2>

<dl>
   <dt>
   <li> New release because there may have been an earlier 1.4-1 on
      the Web site that got overwritten with this version without the
      numbers being updated. 
        
</dl>  

<h2>1.4-1</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Handle case where a "blank"/white-space line in the body of an HTTP response can 
       be treated as part of a (new) header.
  <dd> Found through the rtracklayer package.
</dl> 



<h2>1.4-0</h2>
<dl>


  <dt>
  <li> Minor but important <i>experimental</i> changes to the way the dynamic reader
       process "HTTP 100 Continue" responses and gathering the header
       from the actual call.
  <dd>  Still needs mor refinement, but this should be an improvement.
  
  <dt>
  <li> Added mimeTypeExtensions and guessMIMEType() function.
  <dd> These are useful for mapping a file extension to the common
       MIME type, valuable when uploading/including content in a POST request.
</dl>

<h2>1.3-2</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Minor changes to parsing of HTTP header for 100 "continue" replies.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>1.3-1</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Added curlPercentEncode() and a parameter in postForm() for
    specifying the encoding function. This is of use for
    x-www-form-encoded POST submissions.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>1.3-0</h2>

<dl>
 <dt>
 <li> scp() function for transferring a file from a remote machine to the local one on which the request is made.
 <dd>

 <dt>
 <li> Improved error handling for requests which are not HTTP requests.
 <dd>

 <dt>
  <li> Simpler configuration code for Windows  at the expense of
    unnecessary flexibility in the location of the libcurl development
      files.
  <dd>
      
</dl>




<h2>1.2-1</h2>

<dl>
 <dt>
 <li> getForm() did not use the curl handle object it was passed.
 <dd>
 
</dl>

<h2>1.2-0</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Recognize more Content-Types as being text and so handle the
       (HTTP) response as  text rather than binary for those situations.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>1.1-0</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Support for using default options for new curl handles taken
       from options("RCurlOptions").
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>1.0-0</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> dynCurlReader() (and hence getURLContent()) adds the Content-Type attribute to the
       resulting R object.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> getURLContent() allows the caller to specify the reader for the
       header and body via the <code>header</code> parameter.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.99-0</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Added a binary argument to getURLContent(), getForm() and
      postForm() to allow the caller to control whether the response
      returned by the Web server is treated as binary or text.
      If this is not specified, we examine the Content-Type field in
      the response's header and try to determine from that whether the
      content is binary or text.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> The set of application Content-Types recognized as being text
       is now retrieved from the R options vector via the element <code>text.content.types</code>.
       This allows users to change this set to recognize "new" types.
  <dd>
  <dt>
  <li> Fixed a bug in setting the  HTTPHEADER when a value contained a
       ':' and there was only one value being set.
      <br/>
      curlSetOpt() now detects this case better and also allows the
      caller to explicitly control this via the .forceHeaderNames
      parameter.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> getURLContent() was not honoring ... arguments for setting curl options.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.98-1</h2>

 <dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Added configure- and compile-time checking for different versions and enumerated constants so that
   this will install for older versions of libcurl. Goes all the way back to 7.14.0, i.e. 2005!
  <dd>
 </dl>



<h2>0.98-0</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Added CFILE class and function to allow us to work with files on disk, e.g. for uploading,
       without reading them into R, and for speed to avoid using functions.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.97-3</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> dynCurlReader() discards the original content for the header
       when it is a 100 status and so is ready to read the subsequent
       header after the continuation.
  <dd> Found by Steffen Durinck in biomaRt.
</dl>
      
<h2>0.97-2</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> getURL() example involving listing files in an FTP directory
      now handles newlines of the form \r\n on Windows. Thanks to
      Brian Ripley.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Further tweaks for different versions of libcurl and the generated code mappings.
</dl>

<h2>0.97-1</h2>

 <dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Additional checks in the configuration for existence of specific enumeration constants to handle 
      different versions of libcurl.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.97-0</h2>

 <dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Added configuration-time tests for the existence of newly added enumerations in the options
       and corresponding #ifdef's within the code.   This handles different versions of libcurl
       with different options.  The code in CodeGeneration/generate.R can deal with different
       versions and programmatically create the code for the most recent version of libcurl
       it sees with support for older versions.
  <dd>
 </dl>

<h2>0.96-0</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Updated the number of recognized curl options in <code>curlPerform</code>
       and higher-level functions.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> getCurlInfo() can return certificate information and single linked
       lists that are characters
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li>  Introduced getCurlOptionTypes()  which indicates the expected types of the 
      different options.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Added several C-level enumeration collections as R values.
       These are not exported  as there are many of them.
       They can be accessed with RCurl:::<i>name</i>, e.g.
        <code>RCurl:::CURLPROXY_HTTP_1_0</code>
  <dd> This involves bringing in Enumeration classes from RAutoGenRunTime.

  <dt>
  <li> Configuration tests for recently added libcurl options  in the
       CURLOPT enumerations  and avoid them in compilation if they are not present.
  <dd>
</dl>



<h2>0.95-1</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> parseHTTPHeader() deals with fields in the header that contain
       multiple ':' characters.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> dynCurlReader() handles HTTP 100 status messages to Continue better.
  <dd>      
</dl>1

<h2>0.95-0</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li>  getURLContent() now uses a dynamic reader which processes the
        header and determines the Content-Type (and the encoding if
        text) and reads the body of the reply appropriately.
  <dd>
  
 <dt>
 <li> getForm() now uses getURLContent() and so handles binary results and different character sets.
 <dd>
</dl>


<h2>0.94-1</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Silly initialization omission for the readfunction C routine
       handler which caused the ftpUpload() to produce "infinitely"
       large files on the server.  Thanks to Herve Fulchiron.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.94-0</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Added ftpUpload()  function and small C routine and R function for
       READFUNCTION option callbacks.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Support for QUOTE, POSTQUOTE, PREQUOTE options for FTP.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.93-0</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Added a reset() generic function  and a method for resetting
       the contents of a CURLHandle to the original default values.
  <dd>
  <dt>
  <li> Fixed bug in terminating the string in calls to the debug
       callback function.
  <dd>
</dl>


<h2>0.92-0</h2>

<dl>

  <dt>
  <li>  Added getURLContent() as a top-level function which handles
        binary and text downloads by looking at the Content-Type field
        of the header.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li>  getURLContent() also raises errors for requests with a status in the "400"
       class (e.g. 404 for Not Found) and the errors have (S3) classes that allow
       them to be handled via tryCatch().
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Added getBinaryURL() function as a convenience for downloading
       binary files.  Binary content from POSTing or GETing forms
       can be done by mimicing the few curl settings illustrated
       in getBinaryURL(). 
  <dd>
  <dt>
  <li> Slightly improved error messages when unnamed options are passed
    to curlOptions().
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Fixed a bug in reading binary files when enlarging the "raw" buffer.

  <dt>
  <li> getForm() and postForm() now issue a warning if a curl option
       appears in the parameters for the form.
       This can be legitimate if the form happens to use a parameter
       with the same name as a curl option (see listCurlOptions())
      and the error message can be silenced by explicitly providing
       a value for the .opts parameter in the call.
       The value can be list() or some actual curl options;
       the point is to indicate in the call that you have considered
       the parameters and the curl options.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> The 'statusMessage' field of the HTTP header now contains
       the entire error message rather than the first word.
       Thanks to Valerie Obenchain for identifying the problem.
      
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li>  Errors from HTTP requests now have their own class and use the
        condition system in R (see tryCatch(), simpleError, etc.).
        The names of these error classes come from the HTTP
        specification and are gathered programmatically from the
        specification document. (See inst/HTTPErrors/).
        Unknown/non-matching error status values return a
        GenericHTTPError class. The others return a vector of class
        names containing a more specific class name (whose name is the
        status number) and the more general "HTTPError" class name.
      
      
     
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.9-4</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Fix escaping in the split string  used in
       findHTTPHeaderEncoding which gave rise to warnings about vector
       lengths in an if() condition in getEncoding().
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.9-3</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li>  Changes to remove some simple compiler warnings.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.9-2</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>
  <li> Fix for base64() computing whether to encode or not incorrectly
       due to lazy evaluation.
  <dd>
  
  <dt>
  <li>  Now we use the base64 encode and decode routines from the
      libcurl distribution   with our own names on the routines to avoid synchronization problems.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Fix in chunkToLineReader to report number of "characters" read
       and warning emitted in C code if full number of "characters"
       not consumed.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.9-1</h2>
<dl>
  <dt> Configuration-time check to see if Curl_base64_encode() in
       libcurl (unexported) has the  new additional parameter and so requires us to use that..
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.9-0</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>
  <li> Moved the tests/ directory to inst/examples/.
  <dd> This has some quite rich/advanced examples that should be
      available to people and also take some time to run during R CMD
      check.
      
  <dt>
  <li> Allow for an .encoding parameter in getURL()/getURI() for
       explicitly specifying the encoding of the response from the HTTP.
  <dd>
  <dt>
  <li> A mechanism that reads the HTTP response header and finds the
       Content-Type field and attempts to infer the encoding of the response.
      
  <dd> Note that this registers a handler routine for processing the
       header. This continues to work when an R function is provided as
       for the  headerfunction option, but will not work correctly
       if a routine is provided for the headerfunction option.
      
  <dt>
  <li> Updates to deal with encoding of strings.
  <dd> The basic text gathering function (used as the argument for
       write and the curl option writefunction) returns
       <code>nchar(, "bytes")</code> which may be more than the number
       of characters in an encoded string. 
      
  <dt>
  <li> Replaced internal calls to allocString() with mkCharLenCE() when
       available (i.e. R >= 2.8.0), or explicitly copy the string given
       to us from libcurl and create an encoded character string.
  <dd>

      
</dl>


<h2>0.8-3</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Support for CURLOPT_POST and using
      application/x-www-form-urlencoded as the Content-Type in
      POST'ing a form. This is controlled via the style parameter in postForm.
  <dd>  
  <dt>
  <li> Construct body of a form-urlencoded POST in R with the relevant  escaping.
  <dd>

</dl>



<h2>0.8-1</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Added code to support the new hashing of strings in R-devel
      (for what will be 2.6.0).
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Bug fix which caused segmentation faults when external pointer
      objects were used as options for curl.
  <dd>
  <dt>
  <li> Allow dynamic symbol lookup in the RCurl DLL/SO to permit the
      use of routines such as R_curl_write_binary_data.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.7-0</h2>
 <dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Added support for base64 encoding and decoding using the code from libcurl
    (copyright
  <dd> See the file COPYING.
 </dl>

<h2>0.7-0</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li>  Added mechanism and example for reading binary data from a request.
  <dd>  This is not connected to R's connection mechanism as the API
        for that is not public and external extensions (i.e. via
        packages) are not feasible. (R's internals are not object
        oriented; one must work through the interpreted language even if
        working directly in compiled languages.)
       <p/>
       This is useful for handling gzip/bzip2 files, images, etc.
       To uncompress such in-memory data directly, see the
      Rcompression package.

  <dt>
  <li> fileUpload() function and mechanism for specifying details
       about a file whose contents are to be  included in a form
       submission via postForm.
  <dd>
       
</dl>

<h2>0.6-4</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li>  Fix the problem identified by Seth Falcon of
        releasing/free'ing an R function object in the RCurl memory
        management.
  <dd>  Added a type to the RCurlMemory structure so we know when we
        should R_Release() an object. Probably will also duplicate
        such functions when preserving them.
</dl>


<h2>0.6-3</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>
   Introduced mechanism for converting options to target types, including enumerated values.
  <dd> Works for netrc option and extensible for any of the values.


  <dt> Added support for specifying an R function or C routine
       for the SSL_CTX_FUNCTION option.
  <dd>

  <dt> Accept a logical value from the R function used for the write
    callback.  FALSE indicates an error and TRUE means that the
    function processed the text successfully.
  <dd>

  <dt> Fixed bug in memory management and garbage collection of the
       curl handles.
  <dd>
      
</dl>

<h2>0.6-2</h2>
<dl>
  <dt> Further changes re postForm() with a curl handle provided.
  <dd> Problem was NULL for httppost setting.
</dl>

<h2>0.6-1</h2>
<dl>
  <dt> Fixed type in postForm() that caused error when a curl handle
    was specified.
  <dd>  Name matching in ... of curlSetOpt() caught the cur which
    should have been curl.
      Thanks to Jim McDonal for catching this one and using the
      curl handle mechanism for repeated calls.
</dl>



<h2>0.6-0</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li>  Allow C routines to be passed as values for the CURL options
       that can be R functions.  Use
      <code>getNativeSymbolInfo(routine, package)$address</code>
       to identify the routine.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Support for concurrent, asynchronous HTTP requests using the
     curl_multi interface.</li>
  <dd>  See the examples in tests/
       or on the Web:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="concurrent.html">concurrent</a>  </li>            
      <li><a href="nestedHTML.html">nestedHTML</a>  </li>
      <li><a href="xmlParse.html">xmlParse</a>  </li>
    </ul>

</dl>

<h2>0.5-3</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
    <li>Fixed the SSL example in getURL to turn off verification of
    the peer, i.e.
   <pre>
getURL('https://sourceforge.net', ssl.verifypeer = FALSE)
   </pre></li>
  <dd>
</dl>


<h2>0.5-2</h2>
<dl>
  <dt> Fix for R-devel and counting of \0's in strings for the length.
  <dd>
</dl>


<h2>0.5-1</h2>
<dl>
  <dt> When POSTing a form, only the first string in each element 
       of the list was written to the body of the form. In other
      words, multi-valued elements such as for checkboxes with several
      elements selected were mishandled.
  <dd> 
</dl>


<h2>0.5-0</h2>
<dl>
  <dt> Internal correction for passing numbers as options.
  <dd>  Manifested itself with progress function not being called.

</dl>


<h2>0.4-0</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Use the return value from a CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION
  <dd> This allows the user to raise an error.

  <dt>
  <li> Support the CURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> CURL_CFLAGS and CURL_LIBS computed in configure so as to handle
      no-GNU versions of make.
  <dd>

 </dl>

<h2>0.3-0</h2>
<dl>
  <dt> Ensure that parameters for postForm are a list when passed to
      C code.
  <dd>
</dl>
