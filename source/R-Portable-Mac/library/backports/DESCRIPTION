Description: 
    Functions introduced or changed since R v3.0.0 are re-implemented in this
    package. The backports are conditionally exported in order to let R resolve
    the function name to either the implemented backport, or the respective base
    version, if available. Package developers can make use of new functions or
    arguments by selectively importing specific backports to
    support older installations.
