      is now based on the scaled SVD transformation proposed by Scrucca and
      Raftery (2016).
      This change is not backward compatible. However, previous results can
      be easily obtained by issuing the command:
      mclust.options(hcUse = "VARS")
      For more details see help("mclust.options").
    o Added 'subset' parameter in mclust.options() to control the maximal 
      sample size to be used in the initial model-based hierarchical phase.

      family. A noise component is allowed, but no prior is available. 
    o added mclustBootstrapLRT function (and print and plot methods) for
      selecting the number of mixture components based on the bootstrap 
      sequential likelihood ratio test.
    o added MclustBootstrap function (and print and summary methods) for
      performing bootstrap inference. This provides standard errors for

      rmarkdown and knitr. Older vignettes are included as other
      documentation for the package.

      methods for 'Mclust' and 'MclustDA' objects.
    o bug fixes for transformations in the initialization step when some 
      variables are constant (i.e. the variance is zero) or a one-dimensional
      data is provided.
    o change the order of arguments in hc (and all the functions calling it).

      variables or a transformation of them should be used for
      hierarchical clustering.

      object returned by the main functions.

      of the noise component when required, otherwise is set to NA.
    o add a warning when prior is used and BIC returns NAs.
    o bug fixes for summary.Mclust(), print.summary.Mclust(), plot.Mclust() 
      and icl() in the case of presence of a noise component.
