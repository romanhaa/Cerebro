Description: Tools to run system processes in the background.
    It can check if a background process is running; wait on a background
    process to finish; get the exit status of finished processes; kill
    background processes and their children; restart processes. It can read
    the standard output and error of the processes, using non-blocking
    connections. 'processx' can poll a process for standard output or
    error, with a timeout. It can also poll several processes at once.
