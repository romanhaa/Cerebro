<h2> Calculate the probability that a subgraph has an unusual number
of edges.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For any graph a set of nodes can be used to obtain an induced subgraph
(see <code><a href="subGraph.html">subGraph</a></code>). An interesting question is whether that
subgraph has an unusually large number of edges. This function
computes the probability that a <em>random</em> subgraph with the same
number of nodes has more edges than the number observed in the
presented subgraph. The appropriate probability distribution is
the hypergeometric.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
calcSumProb(sg, g)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>sg</code></td>
<td>
<p> subgraph made from the original graph </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>g</code></td>
<td>
<p> original graph object from which the subgraph was made </p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The computation is based on the following argument. In the original
graph there are <i>n</i> nodes and hence <i>N=n*(n-1)/2</i> edges in the
complete graph. If we consider these <i>N</i> nodes to be of two types,
corresponding to those that are either in our graph, <code>g</code>, or not in
it. Then we think of the subgraph which has say <i>m</i> nodes and
<i>M=m*(m-1)/2</i> possible edges as representing <i>M</i> draws from an
urn containing <i>N</i> balls of which some are white (those in <code>g</code>)
and some are black. We count the number of edges in the subgraph and use
a Hypergeomtric distribution to ask whether our subgraph is particularly
dense. 
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The probability of having greater than or equal to the subgraph's 
number of edges is returned.
