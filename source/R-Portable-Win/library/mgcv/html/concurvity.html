<p>If <code>TRUE</code> then concurvity of each term with the whole of the rest of the model is considered. 
If <code>FALSE</code> then pairwise concurvity measures between each smooth term (as well as the parametric component) 
are considered.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Concurvity occurs when some smooth term in a model could be approximated by one or more of the other smooth terms 
in the model. This is often the case when a smooth of space is included in a model, along with smooths of other covariates 
that also vary more or less smoothly in space. Similarly it tends to be an issue in models including a smooth of time, 
along with smooths of other time varying covariates.
</p>
<p>Concurvity can be viewed as a generalization of co-linearity, and causes similar problems of interpretation. It can also make estimates somewhat unstable (so that they become sensitive to apparently innocuous modelling details, for example). 
</p>
<p>This routine computes three related indices of concurvity, all bounded between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating no problem, 
and 1 indicating total lack of identifiability. The three indices are all based on the idea that a smooth term, f,  
in the model can be decomposed into a part, g, that lies entirely in the space of one or more other terms 
in the model, and a remainder part that is completely within the term's own space. If g makes up a large part of f then there is a concurvity problem. The indices used are all based on the square of ||g||/||f||, that is the ratio of the squared 
Euclidean norms of the vectors of f and g evaluated at the observed covariate values. 
</p>
<p>The three measures are as follows 
</p>

<dl>
<dt>worst</dt><dd><p>This is the largest value that the square of ||g||/||f|| could take for any coefficient vector. This is a fairly pessimistic measure, as it looks at the worst case irrespective of data. This is the only measure that is symmetric.</p>
</dd>
<dt>observed</dt><dd><p>This just returns the value of the square of ||g||/||f|| according to the estimated coefficients. 
This could be a bit over-optimistic about the potential for a problem in some cases. </p>
</dd>
<dt>estimate</dt><dd><p>This is the squared F-norm of the basis for g divided by the F-norm of the basis for f. 
It is a measure of the 
extent to which the f basis can be explained by the g basis. It does not suffer from the pessimism or potential for 
over-optimism of the previous two measures, but is less easy to understand.</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Value</h3>

<p> If <code>full=TRUE</code> a matrix with one column for each term and one row for each of the 3 concurvity measures detailed below. If <code>full=FALSE</code> a list of 3 matrices, one for each of the three concurvity measures detailed below. Each row of 
the matrix relates to how the model terms depend on the model term supplying that rows name.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
library(mgcv)
## simulate data with concurvity...
set.seed(8);n&lt;- 200
f2 &lt;- function(x) 0.2 * x^11 * (10 * (1 - x))^6 + 10 *
            (10 * x)^3 * (1 - x)^10
t &lt;- sort(runif(n)) ## first covariate
## make covariate x a smooth function of t + noise...
x &lt;- f2(t) + rnorm(n)*3
## simulate response dependent on t and x...
y &lt;- sin(4*pi*t) + exp(x/20) + rnorm(n)*.3

## fit model...
b &lt;- gam(y ~ s(t,k=15) + s(x,k=15),method="REML")

## assess concurvity between each term and `rest of model'...
concurvity(b)

## ... and now look at pairwise concurvity between terms...
concurvity(b,full=FALSE)
