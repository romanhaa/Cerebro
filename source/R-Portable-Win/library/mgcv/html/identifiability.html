<h2>Identifiability constraints</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Smooth terms are generally only identifiable up to an additive constant. In consequence sum-to-zero identifiability constraints are imposed on most smooth terms. The exceptions are terms with <code>by</code> variables which cause the smooth to be identifiable without constraint (that doesn't include factor <code>by</code> variables), and random effect terms. Alternatively smooths can be set up to pass through zero at a user specified point.    
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p> By default each smooth term is subject to the sum-to-zero constraint </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>sum_i f(x_i) = 0.</i></p>

<p>The constraint is imposed by reparameterization. The sum-to-zero constraint causes the term to be orthogonal to the intercept: alternative constraints lead to wider confidence bands for the constrained smooth terms.
</p>
<p>No constraint is used for random effect terms, since the penalty (random effect covariance matrix) anyway ensures identifiability in this case. Also if a <code>by</code> variable means that the smooth is anyway identifiable, then no extra constraint is imposed. Constraints are imposed for factor <code>by</code> variables, so that the main effect of the factor must usually be explicitly added to the model (the example below is an exception). 
</p>
<p>Occasionally it is desirable to substitute the constraint that a particular smooth curve should pass through zero at a particular point: the <code>pc</code> argument to <code><a href="s.html">s</a></code>, <code><a href="te.html">te</a></code>, <code><a href="te.html">ti</a></code> and  <code><a href="t2.html">t2</a></code> allows this: if specified then such constraints are always applied.
