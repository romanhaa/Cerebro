<h2>
O'Brien's Test for Association of a Single Variable with Survival
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Peter O'Brien's test for association of a single variable with survival 
This test is proposed in Biometrics, June 1978. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
survobrien(formula, data, subset, na.action, transform)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>formula</code></td>
<td>

<p>a valid formula for a cox model.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>data</code></td>
<td>

<p>a data.frame in which to interpret the variables named in 
the <code>formula</code>, or in the <code>subset</code> and the <code>weights</code>
argument. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>subset</code></td>
<td>

<p>expression indicating which subset of the rows of data should be used in 
the fit.    All observations are included by default. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>na.action</code></td>
<td>

<p>a missing-data filter function.  This is applied to the model.frame
after any 
subset argument has been used.  Default is <code>options()\$na.action</code>. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>transform</code></td>
<td>
<p>the transformation function to be applied at each
time point. The default is O'Brien's suggestion logit(tr) where
tr = (rank(x)- 1/2)/ length(x) is the rank shifted to the range
0-1 and logit(x) = log(x/(1-x)) is the logit transform.
</p>
</td></tr></table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a new data frame.  The response variables will be column names
returned by the <code>Surv</code> function, i.e., &quot;time&quot; and &quot;status&quot; for
simple survival data, or &quot;start&quot;, &quot;stop&quot;, &quot;status&quot; for counting
process data.  Each individual event time is identified by the
value of the variable <code>.strata.</code>.  Other variables retain
their original names.  If a
predictor variable is a factor or is protected with <code>I()</code>, it is 
retained as is.  Other predictor variables have been replaced with 
time-dependent logit scores. 
</p>
<p>The new data frame will have many 
more rows that the original data, approximately the original number
of rows * number of deaths/2. 
</p>


<h3>Method</h3>

<p>A time-dependent cox model can now be fit to the new data. 
The univariate statistic, as originally proposed, is equivalent to 
single variable score tests from the time-dependent model. 
This equivalence is the rationale for using the time dependent model as a 
multivariate extension of the original paper. 
</p>
<p>In O'Brien's method, the x variables are re-ranked at each death time.  A 
simpler method, proposed by Prentice, ranks the data only once at the 
start. The results are usually similar. 
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>A prior version of the routine returned new time variables rather than
a strata.  Unfortunately, that strategy does not work if the original
formula has a strata statement.  This new data set will be the same
size, but the <code>coxph</code> routine will process it slightly faster.
