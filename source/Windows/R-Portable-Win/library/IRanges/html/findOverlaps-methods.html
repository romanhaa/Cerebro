<h2>Finding overlapping ranges</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Various methods for finding/counting interval overlaps between two
&quot;range-based&quot; objects: a query and a subject.
</p>
<p>NOTE: This man page describes the methods that operate on
<a href="IntegerRanges-class.html">IntegerRanges</a> and <a href="IntegerRangesList-class.html">IntegerRangesList</a> derivatives. See
<code>?`<a href="../../GenomicRanges/html/findOverlaps,GenomicRanges,GenomicRanges-method.html">findOverlaps,GenomicRanges,GenomicRanges-method</a>`</code>
in the <span class="pkg">GenomicRanges</span> package for methods that operate on
<a href="../../GenomicRanges/html/GenomicRanges.html">GenomicRanges</a> or <a href="../../GenomicRanges/html/GRangesList.html">GRangesList</a>
objects.

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>query, subject, x, ranges</code></td>
<td>

<p>Each of them can be an <a href="IntegerRanges-class.html">IntegerRanges</a> (e.g. <a href="IRanges-constructor.html">IRanges</a>,
<a href="Views-class.html">Views</a>) or <a href="IntegerRangesList-class.html">IntegerRangesList</a> (e.g. <a href="IRangesList-class.html">IRangesList</a>,
<a href="ViewsList-class.html">ViewsList</a>) derivative.
In addition, if <code>subject</code> or <code>ranges</code> is an <a href="IntegerRanges-class.html">IntegerRanges</a>
object, <code>query</code> or <code>x</code> can be an integer vector to be converted
to length-one ranges.
</p>
<p>If <code>query</code> (or <code>x</code>) is an <a href="IntegerRangesList-class.html">IntegerRangesList</a> object,
then <code>subject</code> (or <code>ranges</code>) must also be an
<a href="IntegerRangesList-class.html">IntegerRangesList</a> object.
</p>
<p>If both arguments are list-like objects with names, each list element
from the 2nd argument is paired with the list element from the 1st
argument with the matching name, if any. Otherwise, list elements are
paired by position. The overlap is then computed between the pairs as
described below.
</p>
<p>If <code>subject</code> is omitted, <code>query</code> is queried against
itself. In this case, and only this case, the <code>drop.self</code>
and <code>drop.redundant</code> arguments are allowed. By default,
the result will contain hits for each range against itself, and if
there is a hit from A to B, there is also a hit for B to A. If
<code>drop.self</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, all self matches are dropped. If
<code>drop.redundant</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, only one of A-&gt;B and B-&gt;A
is returned.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>maxgap</code></td>
<td>

<p>A single integer &gt;= -1.
</p>
<p>If <code>type</code> is set to <code>"any"</code>, <code>maxgap</code> is interpreted as
the maximum <em>gap</em> that is allowed between 2 ranges for the ranges
to be considered as overlapping. The <em>gap</em> between 2 ranges
is the number of positions that separate them. The <em>gap</em> between
2 adjacent ranges is 0. By convention when one range has its start or
end strictly inside the other (i.e. non-disjoint ranges), the <em>gap</em>
is considered to be -1.
</p>
<p>If <code>type</code> is set to anything else, <code>maxgap</code> has a special
meaning that depends on the particular <code>type</code>. See <code>type</code>
below for more information.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>minoverlap</code></td>
<td>

<p>A single non-negative integer.
</p>
<p>Only ranges with a minimum of <code>minoverlap</code> overlapping positions
are considered to be overlapping.
</p>
<p>When <code>type</code> is <code>"any"</code>, at least one of <code>maxgap</code> and
<code>minoverlap</code> must be set to its default value.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>type</code></td>
<td>

<p>By default, any overlap is accepted. By specifying the <code>type</code>
parameter, one can select for specific types of overlap. The types
correspond to operations in Allen's Interval Algebra (see
references). If <code>type</code> is <code>start</code> or <code>end</code>, the
intervals are required to have matching starts or ends,
respectively. Specifying <code>equal</code> as the type returns the
intersection of the <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> matches. If
<code>type</code> is <code>within</code>, the query interval must be wholly
contained within the subject interval. Note that all matches must
additionally satisfy the <code>minoverlap</code> constraint described above.
</p>
<p>The <code>maxgap</code> parameter has special meaning with the special
overlap types. For <code>start</code>, <code>end</code>, and <code>equal</code>,
it specifies the maximum difference in the starts, ends or both,
respectively. For <code>within</code>, it is the maximum amount by which
the subject may be wider than the query. If <code>maxgap</code> is set to -1
(the default), it's replaced internally by 0.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>select</code></td>
<td>

<p>If <code>query</code> is an <a href="IntegerRanges-class.html">IntegerRanges</a> derivative:
When <code>select</code> is <code>"all"</code> (the default), the results are
returned as a <a href="../../S4Vectors/html/Hits.html">Hits</a> object.
Otherwise the returned value is an integer vector <em>parallel</em> to
<code>query</code> (i.e. same length) containing the first, last,
or arbitrary overlapping interval in <code>subject</code>, with <code>NA</code>
indicating intervals that did not overlap any intervals in <code>subject</code>.
</p>
<p>If <code>query</code> is an <a href="IntegerRangesList-class.html">IntegerRangesList</a> derivative:
When <code>select</code> is <code>"all"</code> (the default), the results are
returned as a <a href="../../S4Vectors/html/HitsList.html">HitsList</a> object.
Otherwise the returned value depends on the <code>drop</code> argument.
When <code>select != "all" &amp;&amp; !drop</code>, an <a href="AtomicList-class.html">IntegerList</a> is returned,
where each element of the result corresponds to a space in <code>query</code>.
When <code>select != "all" &amp;&amp; drop</code>, an integer vector is returned
containing indices that are offset to align with the unlisted <code>query</code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>invert</code></td>

<p>If <code>TRUE</code>, keep only the ranges in <code>x</code> that do <em>not</em>
overlap <code>ranges</code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>hits</code></td>
<td>

<p>The <a href="../../S4Vectors/html/Hits.html">Hits</a> or <a href="../../S4Vectors/html/HitsList.html">HitsList</a> object returned
by <code>findOverlaps</code>, or <code>NULL</code>. If <code>NULL</code> then <code>hits</code>
is computed by calling <code>findOverlaps(query, subject, ...)</code> internally
(the extra arguments passed to <code>overlapsRanges</code> are passed to
<code>findOverlaps</code>).

<p>Further arguments to be passed to or from other methods:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>drop</code>: Supported only when <code>query</code> is an
<a href="IntegerRangesList-class.html">IntegerRangesList</a> derivative.
<code>FALSE</code> by default. See <code>select</code> argument above for the
details.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>drop.self</code>, <code>drop.redundant</code>: When <code>subject</code>
is omitted, the <code>drop.self</code> and <code>drop.redundant</code>
arguments (both <code>FALSE</code> by default) are allowed.

details.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A common type of query that arises when working with intervals is
finding which intervals in one set overlap those in another.
</p>
<p>The simplest approach is to call the <code>findOverlaps</code> function
on a <a href="IntegerRanges-class.html">IntegerRanges</a> or other object with range information (aka
&quot;range-based object&quot;).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>For <code>findOverlaps</code>: see <code>select</code> argument above.
</p>
<p>For <code>countOverlaps</code>: the overlap hit count for each range
in <code>query</code> using the specified <code>findOverlaps</code> parameters.
For <a href="IntegerRangesList-class.html">IntegerRangesList</a> objects, it returns an <a href="AtomicList-class.html">IntegerList</a>
object.
</p>
<p><code>overlapsAny</code> finds the ranges in <code>query</code> that overlap any
of the ranges in <code>subject</code>. For <a href="IntegerRanges-class.html">IntegerRanges</a> derivatives,
it returns a logical vector of length equal to the number of
ranges in <code>query</code>. For <a href="IntegerRangesList-class.html">IntegerRangesList</a> derivatives,
it returns a <a href="AtomicList-class.html">LogicalList</a> object where each element of the result
corresponds to a space in <code>query</code>.
</p>
<p><code>%over%</code> and <code>%within%</code> are convenience wrappers for the
2 most common use cases. Currently defined as
<code>`%over%` &lt;- function(query, subject) overlapsAny(query, subject)</code>
and
<code>`%within%` &lt;- function(query, subject)
                        overlapsAny(query, subject,
  type="within")</code>. <code>%outside%</code> is simply the inverse of <code>%over%</code>.
</p>
<p><code>subsetByOverlaps</code> returns the subset of <code>x</code> that
has an overlap hit with a range in <code>ranges</code> using the specified
<code>findOverlaps</code> parameters.
</p>
<p>When <code>hits</code> is a <a href="../../S4Vectors/html/Hits.html">Hits</a> (or <a href="../../S4Vectors/html/HitsList.html">HitsList</a>)
object, <code>overlapsRanges(query, subject, hits)</code> returns a
<a href="IntegerRanges-class.html">IntegerRanges</a> (or <a href="IntegerRangesList-class.html">IntegerRangesList</a>) object of the <em>same
shape</em> as <code>hits</code> holding the regions of intersection between the
overlapping ranges in objects <code>query</code> and <code>subject</code>, which should
be the same query and subject used in the call to <code>findOverlaps</code> that
generated <code>hits</code>.
<em>Same shape</em> means same length when <code>hits</code> is a
<a href="../../S4Vectors/html/Hits.html">Hits</a> object, and same length and same elementNROWS
when <code>hits</code> is a <a href="../../S4Vectors/html/HitsList.html">HitsList</a> object.
</p>
<p><code>poverlaps</code> compares <code>query</code> and <code>subject</code> in parallel
(like e.g., <code>pmin</code>) and returns a logical vector indicating
whether each pair of ranges overlaps. Integer vectors are treated as
width-one ranges.
</p>
<p><code>mergeByOverlaps</code> computes the overlap between query and subject
according to the arguments in <code>...</code>. It then extracts the
corresponding hits from each object and returns a <code>DataFrame</code>
containing one column for the query and one for the subject, as well
as any <code>mcols</code> that were present on either object. The query and
subject columns are named by quoting and deparsing the corresponding
argument.
</p>
<p><code>findOverlapPairs</code> is like <code>mergeByOverlaps</code>, except it
returns a formal <code><a href="../../S4Vectors/html/Pairs-class.html">Pairs</a></code> object
that provides useful downstream conveniences, such as finding the
intersection of the overlapping ranges with <code><a href="setops-methods.html">pintersect</a></code>.
