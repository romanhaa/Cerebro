<h2>DEPRECATED Functions that find the homology data for a given set of
LocusLink ids or HomoloGeneIDs</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These functions are DEPRECATED. All this functionality has been
replaced by inPARANOID packages.
Given a set of LocusLink ids or NCBI HomoloGeneIDs, the functions obtain the
homology data and represent them as a list of sub-lists using the
homology data package for the organism of interest. A sub-list can be of
length 1 or greater depending on whether a LocusLink id can be mapped
to one or more HomoloGeneIDs.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
LL2homology(homoPkg, llids)
HGID2homology(hgid, homoPkg)
ACC2homology(accs, homoPkg)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>llids</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>llids</code> a vector of character strings or numberic
numbers for a set of LocusLink ids whose homologous genes in other
organisms are to be found</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>hgid</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>hgid</code> a named vector of character strings or numberic
numbers for a set of HomoloGeneIDs whose homologous genes in other
organisms are to be found. Names of the vector give the code used by
NCBI for organisms</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>accs</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>accs</code> a vector of character strings for a set of
GenBank Accession numbers</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>homoPkg</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>homoPkg</code> a character string for the name of the
homology data package for a given organism, which is a short version
of the scientific name of the organism plus homology (e. g. hsahomology)</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The homology data package has to be installed before executing any of
the two functions.
</p>
<p>Each sub-list  has the following elements:
</p>
<p>homoOrg - a named vector of a single character string whose value
is the scientific name of the organism and name the numeric code
used by NCBI for the organism.
</p>
<p>homoLL - an integer for LocusLink id.
</p>
<p>homoHGID - an integer for internal HomoloGeneID.
</p>
<p>homoACC - a character string for GenBank accession number of the
best matching sequence of the organism.
</p>
<p>homoType - a single letter for the type of similarity measurement
between the homologous genes. homoType can be either B (reciprocal
best best between three or more organisms), b (reciprocal best
match between two organisms), or c (curated homology relationship
between two organisms).
</p>
<p>homoPS - a percentage value measured as the percent of identity of
base pair alignment between the homologous sequences. 
</p>
<p>homoURL - a url to the source if the homology relationship is a
curated orthology.
</p>
<p>Sub-lists with homoType = B or b will not have any value
for homoURL and objects with homoType = c will not have any value
for homoPS.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Both functions returns a list of sub-lists containing data for
homologous genes in other organisms.
