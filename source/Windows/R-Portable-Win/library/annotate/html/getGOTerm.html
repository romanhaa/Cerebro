<h2>Functions to Access GO data.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These functions provide access to data in the GO package. The data are
assembled from publically available data from the Gene Ontology
Consortium (GO), <a href="www.go.org">www.go.org</a>. Given a list of GO identifiers they
access the children (more specific terms), the parents (less specific
terms) and the terms themselves.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
getGOTerm(x)
getGOParents(x)
getGOChildren(x)
getGOOntology(x)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector of valid GO identifiers. </p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>GO consists of three (soon to be more) specific hierarchies: Molecular
Function (MF), Biological Process (BP) and Cellular Component
(CC). For more details consult the GO website. For each GO identifier
each of these three hierarchies is searched and depending on the
function called the appropriate values are obtained and returned.
</p>
<p>It is possible for a GO identifier to have no children or for it to
have no parents. However, it must have a term associated with it.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of the same length as <code>x</code>.
The list contains one entry for each element of <code>x</code>. That entry
is itself a list. With one component named <code>Ontology</code> which
has as its value one of MF, BP or CC. The second component has the
same name as the suffix of the call, i.e. Children, Parents, or Term.
If there was no match in any of the ontologies then a length zero list
is returned for that element of <code>x</code>.
</p>
<p>For <code>getGOOntology</code> a vector of categories (the names of which
are the original GO term names). Elements of this list that are
<code>NA</code> indicate term names for which there is no category (and
hence they are not really term names).
