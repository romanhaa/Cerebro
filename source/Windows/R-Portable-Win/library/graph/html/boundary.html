<h2> Returns the Boundary between a Graph and a SubGraph </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The boundary of a subgraph is the set of nodes in the original graph
that have edges to nodes in the subgraph. The function <code>boundary</code>
computes the boundary and returns it as a list whose length is the same
length as the number of nodes in the subgraph.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
boundary(subgraph, graph)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p> the original graph from which the boundary will 
be created </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>subgraph</code></td>
<td>
<p> can either be the vector of the node labels or the
subgraph itself.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <em>boundary</em> of a <em>subgraph</em> is the set of nodes in the
graph which have an edge that connects them to the specified subgraph
but which are themselves not elements of the subgraph.
</p>
<p>For convenience users can specify the subgraph as either a graph or a
vector of node labels.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This function returns a named list of length equal to the number of
nodes in <code>subgraph</code>. The elements of the list
correspond to the nodes in the <code>subgraph</code>. The elements are lists
of the nodes in <code>graph</code> which share an edge with the
respective node in <code>subgraph</code>.
