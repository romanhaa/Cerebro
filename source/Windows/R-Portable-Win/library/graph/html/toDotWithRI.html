<h2>Translate a graph to &quot;dot&quot; including rendering information</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function takes a graph object and translates it into the dot
format. All rendering information is written verbatim into the dot
graph as well
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
toDotWithRI(graph, graph_name = NULL, subGraphList = list(),
  isStrict = TRUE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of graph <code>graph</code></p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>graph_name</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the graph</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>subGraphList</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of objects of class <code>graph</code>. Each of
these is used as a subgraph in the graph. The names in the list are
taken as the names of the subgraph. If a graph is to be seen as a
cluster (i.e. with a box around it), its name has to start with
<code>cluster</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>isStrict</code></td>
<td>
<p>Should the graph be strict</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Given a graph object, it is translated into the <code>dot</code> language so
that it can be rendered using the <code>graphviz</code> software. In
addition to plotting the graph itself, all the rendering information
is being used as well.
</p>
<p><code>graphRenderInfo</code> attributes are written as an attribute list
after the <code>graph</code> statement in dot.
</p>
<p><code>nodeRendenInfo</code> attributes are written as attribute lists after
each node. If an attribute is constant across all node, a global node
attribute is written instead of many individual ones.##' Newlines ##'
in attributes do not lead to newlines in labels. In <code>label</code>,
<code>headlabel</code> and <code>taillabel</code>, in order to get a newline,
right justification or left justification, the two character sequences
<code>\n</code>, <code>\r</code> and <code>\l</code> have to be written (i.e. in
order to create this in R, the backslash has to be escaped in a
string, that is has to be written as a double-backslash).
</p>
<p><code>edgeRenderInfo</code> attributes as written as attribute lists after
each edge, unless an attribute is constant, then it is written as a
global edge attribute.
</p>
<p>In general, all attribute values are being wrapped in double-quotes,
unless the attibute value start with a <code>&lt;</code> and ends with a
<code>&gt;</code>. In this case it is taken as html content and not wrapped in
double quotes (nor are contained newlines escaped).
</p>
<p>The resulting graph in dot format is returned as a character vector.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A character vector with the graph in dot format
