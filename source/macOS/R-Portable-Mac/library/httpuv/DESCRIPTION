Description: Provides low-level socket and protocol support for handling
    HTTP and WebSocket requests directly from within R. It is primarily
    intended as a building block for other packages, rather than making it
    particularly easy to create complete web applications using httpuv alone.
    httpuv is built on top of the libuv and http-parser C libraries, both of
    which were developed by Joyent, Inc. (See LICENSE file for libuv and
    http-parser license information.)
